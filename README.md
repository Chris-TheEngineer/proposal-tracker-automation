# Proposal Tracker – Automated Excel System

This project was built to streamline Acumen’s internal workflow for tracking proposals, deadlines, and production.

## Problem
The original workflow was difficult to navigate, with information scattered across different sheets and manual processes.

## Solution
- Created a structured Excel-based tracking system
- Built-in dropdowns, automated summaries, and task sheets
- Dynamic 12-month calendar view that updates as tasks are added
- Includes conditional formatting and color-coded status tracking

## Tools Used
- Excel (Power formulas + data validation)
- VBA for calendar automation
